<b>Edge Cutting</b>

You have an undirected tree of n nodes.some nodes have color A, some have color B, some have color C. It is sure that nodes of color of A and B are present.
Find number of edges you can remove such that removing that edge divides the tree in 2 components such that one component do not have nodes of color A. and another component do not have color of B
